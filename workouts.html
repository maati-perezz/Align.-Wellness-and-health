		<h3 class="alumni-sans-pinstripe-regular">In this exercise, the person is lying on a mat with her knees bent and hips lifted, creating a straight bridge line from shoulders to knees. While holding the bridge position, she extends her arms straight above her chest and uses dumbbells to perform a controlled press. The movement activates the glutes and hamstrings to keep the hips elevated, while the arm press engages the chest, shoulders, and core. It’s a full-body toning exercise that works stability and strength at the same time.Here, the person is balancing on her sitting bones with both legs extended upward and the torso leaning back slightly, creating a strong “V” shape. Her arms are reaching forward, parallel to the legs, helping maintain the position. This posture forces the abdominal muscles—especially the lower abs—to work continuously to keep the body lifted. It also challenges balance and strengthens the hip flexors while giving the entire core a clean, toned look.</h3>

		<h3 class="alumni-sans-pinstripe-regular">In this yoga pose, the person is lying on her back and lifting her legs and hips upward, supporting her lower back with her hands. One leg stretches straight up, while the other bends gracefully toward the chest, creating a long, elegant line with the extended leg. The body weight is supported mainly on the shoulders, allowing the spine to lengthen upward. This pose stimulates circulation, strengthens the core, and provides a deep stretch through the back and legs, giving a light, elevated feeling.In this variation, the person lifts her hips and supports them with her hands while letting one leg reach overhead toward the floor behind her. The other leg stays extended upward, forming a split-like shape in the air. Her upper back and shoulders rest on the mat, allowing the spine to lengthen as the hips tilt. This pose combines flexibility and control, deeply stretching the hamstrings and lower back while engaging the core to hold the shape gracefully.</h3>
